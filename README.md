# Threshold-Linear-Networks

Our brain is a dynamical system. There are approximately 100 billion neurons in this 3 pounds of fat, protein and carbs. One of the goals of neuroscientists is to analyze the firing rate of these neurons and find a pattern in human cognition and memory. 

One of those models which explains memory is the threshold linear networks which are continuum based descendents of [Hopfield networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network)

The CTLN_colab.ipynb file contains python implementations of the threshold linear networks studied in the following papers:
* [Morrison, Katherine & Degeratu, Anda & Itskov, Vladimir & Curto, Carina. (2016). Diversity of emergent dynamics in competitive threshold-linear networks: a preliminary report.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04463)
* [Carina Curto and Katherine Morrison. Graph rules for recurrent neural network dynamics: extended version.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12638.pdf)

# Installation

pip install https://github.com/AImeetsAG/Threshold-Linear-Networks-Computational-Neuroscience-.git/master

or

git clone https://github.com/AImeetsAG/Threshold-Linear-Networks-Computational-Neuroscience-.git

then
sudo python setup.py install

# Example 
Look at the example.ipynb files for implementations of all the functions including their descriptions.
There is only one class that needs to be defined: graphtodynamics
